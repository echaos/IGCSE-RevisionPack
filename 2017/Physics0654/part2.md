# Part 2 Matter and force

## Distinguish between the mass and weight of an object.

- Mass is a measure of **how much matter** is in an object.
- Weight is a force acting on that matter.

## Weight and gravitational field
- Weight is the result of gravity. 
- The gravitational **field strength** of the Earth is 10 N/kg (ten newtons per kilogram).  
*This means an object with a mass of 1kg would be **attracted** towards the centre of the Earth by a force of 10N. We feel forces like this as weight.*;

## Mass and resists

Objects with a large mass (eg a car) are difficult to move because they have '**inertia**'
- resistance to a change in speed 
- remain the previous motion state

## Why force change the shape size & motion

- Force can change the shape beacaus of force can change the arrangement of the molecules
- Every mass stays at rest or moves at constant speed in a straight line unless a resultant force acts on it.

## What is Hook's law
  $ Force = constant\*extension (F=kx) $

- The force is proportional to the extension.

## Pressure

 Pressure = Force / Area
