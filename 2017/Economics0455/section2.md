## Unit-6 Change in Demand
<span id="demand" />
## Unit-7 Change in Supply
<span id="supply" />
## Unit-8 PED
<span id="ped" />

### The usage of PED for Government
1. Knowledge of PED would help a government estimate **how much tax** revenue (1) it may earn from indirect taxes/changes in **indirect taxes** (1) may earn **more** on products with **inelastic** demand (1).

2. Knowledge of PED may help a government to estimate **how much of a subsidy** to give (1) a subsidy will have more of an **impact** on **quantity** (1) if demand is **elastic** (1).
3. Knowledge of PED will help a government estimate how successful it may be in **reducing consumption** of a product (1) **example**, e.g. cigarettes (1) more likely to be successful if demand is **elastic** (1).

4. Knowledge of PED may influence the **price** the **government-produced** goods (1) **example** of a product (1).

## Unit-9 PES
<span id="pes" />

### Factors of PES

1. The **time** taken to produce it

2. The **cost** of **altering** its supply

3. The ability to **store** it

4. **Time period** under consideration(1) supply is more **inelastic** in **short run**(2)
