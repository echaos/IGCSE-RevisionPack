# Chapter 7 Rate of reaction

## Factors of reaction rate

1. Concentration
2. Particle size
3. Catalysis
4. Temperature

## Pratical method for investigating the rate of a reaction involving gas

### Equipment

- Gas syringe
- Excess hydrochloric acid
- Magnesium strip
- Stopper
- Sandpaper
- Conical flask

### Steps

1. Remove impurities from magnesium strip using sandpaper.
2. Pour excess hydrochloric acid into conical flask
3. Add magnesium strip into flask
4. Quickly put on stopper and gas syringe
5. Measure how much the syringe moves back every 20 seconds. This will show the speed of the reaction.

## Test factors

- Concentration: use different concentrations of acids
- Particle size: use reactants in different shape
- Catalyst: add catalyst to one experiment, and remain another experiment unchange
- Temperature: Place two same experiment in different temperature and measure their rates

## Why temperature and concentration change the reaction rate(involve concepts of particles)

- Temperature: More kinetic energy will be given to the particles, so the frequency of collisions between particles will increase

- Concentration: More particles will be in the solution, so there will be more collision

## Why fine powder will explode

- Flour Mills: the flour particles have a huge surface area, so a spark can easily cause the quick combustion of flour particles and form an explosion

- Coal Mine: Lots of gases in te mine are flammable. At the right concentration , the gases will explode

## What is catalyst

- An agent which increase rate but which remains unchanged.

## What is Redox

- Electron transfer

- Oxidation: loss electrons
- Reduction: gain electrons
